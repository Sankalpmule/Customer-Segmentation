# customer-segmentation-python
This project applies customer segmentation to the customer data from a company and derives conclusions and data driven ideas based on it.
### Dataset
This data set is the customer data of a online super market company Ulabox. The data set is available in this link https://github.com/ulabox/datasets
### Customer segmentation
In customer segmentation we categorize similar customers together in the same cluster and analyse them. It can reveal information like: 
1) who are the most valuable customers of the company 
2) what kinds of customers does the company have
3) This can be used for targeted marketing and other marketing strategies.
4) Sometimes it can even reveal a potential white space in the market place which no company has yet occupied.
Well we can get creative here.
### Clustering
Clustering is a process in which we put similar data points into the same cluster. There are a lot of algorithms to do this, for example agglomerative heirarchical clustering, kmeans clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model etc.
